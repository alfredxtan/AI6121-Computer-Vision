This is the second assignment on image stitching. This is done by performing the following:

1. Detect feature points using SIFT
2. Comparing the feature points across two images of the same scene in different perspectives
3. Recovering the homography matrix with RANSAC
4. Transforming and overlaying the two images to stitch them together.
