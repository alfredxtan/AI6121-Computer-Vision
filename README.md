# AI6121-Computer-Vision
This repository consists of the codes and reports for the various assignments and a final project for the course AI6121 Computer Vision. 

There were two assignments and one project. The first assignment involves the use of histogram equalization for contrast correction, while the second assignment involves image stitching using homography transformation. The final project involves image-to-image translation in the form of CycleGAN and unsupervised domain adaptation in the form of CyCADA.
